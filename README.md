# Generative Art in Python
Examples on how Python can be used to create generative art, which can be turned into NFTs on popular marketplaces like objkt.com. This example code shows how you can use a `polar projection` to create generative art with a circular pattern while alternating foreground and background colors.

# Getting Started
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


# Dependencies
These examples are dependent upon the `matplotlib` and `samila` libraries.
